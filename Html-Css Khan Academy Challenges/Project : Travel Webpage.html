/*
In this project, you'll use everything you've learned so far to create a travel website enticing viewers to visit an exotic locale. You should have images of what they'll see, lists
of things to see and places to go, and paragraphs of enticing details. You should also use CSS to style the website, using a mix of the simple selectors you've learned.

Tip: Can't find the images you want in our image selector? You can also bring in images from Wikipedia. To do that, use a site-restricted Google search, then click "View image" on the
result you like, and copy the URL into your <img> tag.

        <li>Tackling climate change is a global effort, and everyone — businesses, governments, individuals — has an important role to play. So it’s critical that we all have access
        to high-quality, credible information to understand how our everyday choices might affect the environment. For example, air travel, which accounts for <em><strong>2-3%</strong>
        </em> of global CO2 emissions, is one area where we can make a big impact. In fact, global search interest in “sustainable travel” has increased by <em><strong>100%</strong></em>
        over the past five years.</li>

        <li>To help travelers make more sustainable choices, we created the Travel Impact Model (TIM), a public and freely accessible methodology for predicting the per-passenger CO2 emissions
        produced by an upcoming flight. Today, the TIM powers the emissions estimates you see on Google Flights, as well as sites like Booking.com, Expedia and Skyscanner, through our work in the
        Travalyst coalition.</li>

        <li>Over time, we’ve refined and improved the TIM with help from academic and nonprofit experts, as well as various partners in the travel industry. Now, we’re formalizing these collaborative
        efforts by establishing an independent advisory committee to oversee future changes to the TIM.</li>

        <li>With the International Council on Clean Transportation serving as the Secretariat, this new committee brings together a group of uniquely qualified individuals and organizations:</li></ol>

        <h2>Summary :</h2>

        <p id="last">Starting this month, the TIM Advisory Committee will convene on a regular basis to discuss and approve updates to the model by incorporating the latest scientific knowledge
        in the field of flight emissions forecasting. Google will continue to administer the technical implementation of the TIM, including the management of API access and relevant data sources
        from standardized industry feeds.<br>

        While there’s still a long road ahead to make aviation more sustainable, increasing transparency for travelers is an important step forward. We’ll continue to work across the travel sector
        to make sure you can find consistent and reliable data, no matter where you research your next trip.
