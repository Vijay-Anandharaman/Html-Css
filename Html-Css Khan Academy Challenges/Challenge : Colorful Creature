        <p>Cheetahs are the <em>world’s fastest</em> land animal, capable of reaching speeds of up to 70 mph. 
           Standing at about <em><strong>30 inches</strong></em> tall at the shoulder and weighing between 110
           and 140 pounds, they have long, graceful legs; a small, rounded head on a long neck; a very flexible
           spine; a deep chest; special pads on their feet that help with traction; and a long tail that is used
           for balance at top speed. The cheetah is also the only cat that cannot retract its claws, providing more
           traction. They also have distinctive black “tear tracks” that run from the corner of each eye to their mouth
           and provide anti-glare protection for daytime hunting.
