/*
A "blog" (or "web log") is an online journal, which one or multiple people update on a frequent basis, like daily, weekly, or monthly. Many new programmers keep blogs to document their journey
to becoming a programmer, with updates on what they've learned and what they've made.

There are many "blogging engines" out there, like WordPress and Blogger, but in this project, you'll make your own blog using HTML and CSS. It should have at least 2 entries, and the table of
contents should internally link to each entry. Use CSS text properties to style your blog - like changing the font family, line height, and font styles of various sections.

If you like your blog, then you could use it to document your journey here - make it a featured project on your profile, then people that visit your profile will get to read about your journey!

        <p id="fav-kowsa">The dish, known as ohn no khao swè, originated in Burma, and came to the Memon community of Pakistan who adapted this dish, likely coinciding with the emigration of
        South Asians from Burma in the 1960s, and is now a representative Memon dish now known as khausa. The meaning of <strong>Khausa</strong> is happiness, delight, pleasure, mirth, joy,
        rejoicings, cheerfulness, gladness, gaiety. We want to the kowsa shop in the evening time. I ate the kowsa with my friends.</p>

        <p id ="fav-briyani">It is said that Mumtaz once visited the army barracks and found the <em><strong>Mughal</strong></em> soldiers looking weak and undernourished. She asked the chef to
        prepare a special dish that combined meat and rice to provide balanced nutrition to the soldiers – and the result was biryani of course. This meal has a deep taste and is filled with flavour.
        It is a well-known dish from the Indian subcontinent that is enjoyed worldwide. Basmati rice is combined with various spices and cooked uniquely to make biryani.</p>
